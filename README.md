# WTF is the A-- programming language?!

## Who am I
Hi! I'm Abdoo. An Algerian guy who **LOVES** programming.

## What is this project?!
This project is an idea I had since I was like 12-13 years old.
I always thought that a programming language scanned the whole script/code *(file)*
and that for every keyword it found, it did a certain action like `if`, `for`... *(etc)*

But it is not the case, so here is my idea! It will probably be ***very very __slow__*** 
because it uses **Python** and the way the language works is pretty *slow*.


> Btw, there is a file extension `.amm` and it is the same as a file extensiont that
is used for movie storing stuff.


### How A-- works?
You could say that ***A--*** works like a normal programming language, it just lacks
a **BUNCH** of features, but it is a programming language for fun, so (:.

### How does A-- run?
Unlike other programming languages, that usually use ***C*** as a "base" you could say,
***A--*** actually uses Python as a base.

There is a Python script called `runner.py`, it is the file/script that will run the `.amm`
program


# Get Started

## How to run a A-- program
Like I said before, ***A--*** uses Python as a base. So to get started, you should have:

* Python downloaded *(Python's version must be newer than **3.10**)*
* The `runner.py` script
* The **A--** file *(`.amm`)* template of course! You will learn from it the basics of this
disaster, or just check the [**Github Repo**](https://github.com/AbdooOwd/AMM_lang)
