# WTF is the A-- programming language?!

## Who am I
Hi! I'm Abdoo. An Algerian guy who **LOVES** programming.

## What is this project?!
This project is an idea I had since I was like 12-13 years old.
I always told myself that a programming language scanned the whole script/code *(file)*
and that for every keyword it did a certain action like `if`, `for`... *(etc)*

But it is not the case, so here is my idea! It will probably be ***very very __slow__*** 
because it uses **Python** and the way the language works is pretty *slow*.


> Btw, there is a file extension `.amm` and it is the same as a file extensiont that
is used for movie storing stuff.
